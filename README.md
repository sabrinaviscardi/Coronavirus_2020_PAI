<h2 align="left">Coronavirus</h2>
<p align="left"> In the context of the pandemic our goal is to inform and encourage good practices to face the covid-19. In an interactive way, we tried to contribute to this new normality with a web product.</p>

<h2 align="left">What did we use?</h2>
<p align="left">We used HTML5 for markup and CSS3 to style our web. Also, we used javascrpit to add some click events to make the final product more fun and interactive.</p>

<h2 align="left">Results</h2>
<p align="left">We believe that we were able build a friendly website that meets its mission. What do you think?</p>
